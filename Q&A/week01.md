# Week-01 Q&A Session

## CLI Questions

1. Mac OS comes with the Bourne Again SHell (bash) and also includes the TENEX C shell (tcsh), the Korn shell (ksh), and the Z shell (zsh). Which one is the best to use as a Web Developer?

## HTML Questions

1. There are 4 types of naming convention as far as I know and they are camelCase, PascalCase, kebap-case, and snake_case. Which one is the best to use for HTML/CSS id and class names?

2. When I think about a very big website project, there would be so many sections, divs, etc. and also different parts would be done by different developers. So it is very hard for me to decide for giving names for ids and classes. Is there any rule or strategy for naming ids and classes to do it systematically and professionally?

## CSS Questions

1. In CSS, we can use margin and padding attributes for laying out our contents. As a specific example, if there are two elements, we can use margin or padding for first element or second element to increase distance between them. So there are many combinations for doing that and I'm getting lost and confused to decide what to do. How can I make this kind of cases easier?
