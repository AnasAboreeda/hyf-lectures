## JavaScript-1 Question

As far as I know, there are a few different ways to define a function in JavaScript. For instance;

1. Function Declarations
   
  ```JavaScript
  function myFunction_01(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  }
  ```
2. Function Expressions
   
  ```JavaScript
  const myFunction_02 = function (a, b) {
    return a * b;
  };
  ```
3. Arrow Functions

  ```JavaScript
  const myFunction_03 = (a, b) => {
    return a * b;
  };
  ```
Is the only difference between these definitions syntactically? And are there any pros and cons in practice?
