# Week-05 Q&A Session

## JavaScript-2 Questions

1. We can solve a problem by using `if/else if/else` or `switch/case`. So is there any conventions to decide which one is better to use?
2. Similar to conditionals, there are so many loop concept such as `for`, `forEach`, `for...in`, `for...of`. Does it matter which one we use?
3. On [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), there are some concepts such as;

- Basic JavaScript
- ES6
- Regular Expressions ("regex" or "regexp")
- Basic Data Structures
- Object Oriented Programing
- Functional Programing

Are we going to use all the concepts above in web development?
