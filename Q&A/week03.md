# Week-03 Q&A Session

## CSS Question

While I'm doing my week3 project, I used materialize CSS and custom CSS. For mobile devices, I choosed Iphone 5S and arranged my layout for it **perfectly**. But when I switch to other mobile devices, **I lose my perfectness :)** although I use vh, vw, % etc.
I have similar issue for tablet and desktop devices. How can I handle this issue?
